# Design Tokens Format Module

*— A Typescript implementation of the [Design Tokens Format Module](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) specification along with some utility functions*

### Abstract

This repository aims to provide comprehensive tooling to work with the Design Tokens Format Module specification when it comes to parse, validate and (maybe) generate design token files.

> ⚠️ Please note, neither the DTCG specification nor this library are stable yet.
> The DTCG specification is currently under draft phase and the library might integrate unstable APIs for the sake of research.

### Usage

// TODO


### Roadmap

- [x] Implement the latest specification Typescript type definition
- [x] Add a parse function to traverse any given token tree
- [x] Resolve aliases
- [x] Add validation logic for all known token types
- [ ] Expose parse API with options for alias resolution and metadata population
- [ ] Expose proper types for external consumers
- [ ] Document usage
